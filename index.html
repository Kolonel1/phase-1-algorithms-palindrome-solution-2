<!-- like i already knew you can access each character of a string like an array 
i kind of remember it vaguely but not vividly 
now all about optimizing the code 

remember that you can compare all types of expression 
you can even compare a variable to the result of a function which will be returned when the function is 
called


const reversedWord = reverseString(word);
i wonder how this works
now i am looking at the code and i am wondering if what i have stated is possible or not

creating additional arrays and strings is not efficient in times of time complexities and the sort
